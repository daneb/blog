1. Joy and love in the home. These two things will cover a multitude of parental errors
2. Strong loving parents - kids know Dad and Mum are one unit, there's no division
3. Training and Self-control - allowing them time to grow and make mistakes, self-control around food and behaviours, as this is key to successful life. Very important.
4. Teaching them to think, not what to think (of course in the right contexts)
5. Consistency - let your no be no, and your yes be yes.
6. Prioritisation - we function as a family, kids are not separate. Our kids are our best friends.
