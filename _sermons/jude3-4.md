## Beloved, Contend and Beware

* We continue with our series on Jude, and let's just recap
* It's one of the shortest books of the Bible, written between 60 and 80 AD.
* It's written by Jude brother of James, and half-brother of Jesus.
* Both brothers each wrote a general epistle and neither used their authority in being Jesus Christ's brothers.
* Jude is very closely linked and can be read alongside 2 Peter, particularly 2 Peter 2.

### 1.2 Diligence vs Needful

## Conclusion
It's also interesting to note, that while in Jude we are being warned against false teachers and men who will creep in unaware to the degree of being equipped to abate or avoid it, it's easier said then done.
