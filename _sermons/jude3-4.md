## Beloved, Contend and Beware

* We continue with our series on Jude, and let's just recap
* It's one of the shortest books of the Bible, written between 60 and 80 AD.
* It's written by Jude brother of James, and half-brother of Jesus.
* Both brothers each wrote a general epistle and neither used their authority in being Jesus Christ's brothers.
* Jude is very closely linked and can be read alongside 2 Peter, particularly 2 Peter 2.

Before we dive into verse 3 and 4 for today, let's set the table.
Please turn your Bibles to Joshua 9:1-9, 15. Keep your hand on that portion if you will. 
And let's turn to Matthew 26, and read with from verse 46-50.

### Introduction

> What is common theme between these two narratives?
> Deception and betrayal.

This is the the thrust of what we will be seeing in the book of Jude, Jude warning us, waking us up from sleep, calling out, being a watchmen and shouting from the lookout tower, the enemy is coming, the enemy is coming. In the time of AD 60-80AD, this was the message, and this message echoes on today, in this church, in your life, in your workplace.

Let's turn to the Lord in prayer.

## Contend

### 1.1 Beloved

* Before Jude gets into the thick of things, he states one of his motivations, and it's loved. 
* Not at the start of verse 3, he begins with the word _beloved_, that is, greatly loved.
* It's easy to criticize, but when love meets criticism it becomes critical to pay attention. The person in question has taken the time to consider you, to consider your life, it's course and apply their mind to equipping you for the future. This is what Jude is doing.

### 1.2 Diligence vs Needful

#### i. Common Salvation

 We see the words _"common salvation"_ in this case is that which is now common between those are Christ's saints, those who are saved. Between us is the commonality of Christ, and His defining work on calvary to redeem us His bride, the church.

#### ii. Note the Tension

* But it is not to this that Jude calls to attention. Note the tension here on the first part of verse 3. He starts of with the intention to write about this common salvation but instead moves to follow the leading of the Holy Spirit to earnestly contend for the faith.
* Note the words, _"when I gave all diligence to write unto you"_ (perhaps he already wrote a letter, perhaps his mind had prayed and thought through what the Lord would have Him say, or what he would say from his heart)
* But we then see _"it was needful"_, as in more important.

#### iii. A breakdown

* The focus of this verse is clearly on the latter half which we will get to in a moment. But it's interesting to pause an learn from Jude's behavior.

* Diligence definition: steady application of effort
  
> Brethren, give diligence to make your calling and election sure. 2 Pet 1.

* Needful definition: necessary, as supply or relief
  
> Luke 10:42  But one thing is needful: and Mary hath chosen that good part, which shall not be taken away from her.

#### iv. Example of Mary

* We note from the story of Mary and Martha, one just to be busy fulfilling her duty, and the other choosing to that which was more needful, of necessity and that was to be at feet of Jesus.
* Note firstly how this interaction is recorded in scripture, and from the words of our Lord Jesus Christ himself.
* Note also how Jude shares this intent with the church to whom his writing.

#### v. Application to us

* That leads me too, today where are you in your walk with Christ?
* Yes we are bound by our duty to serve and love others and evangelize to the lost, but are heeding the Holy Spirit in what may be needful for you today.
* Martha was diligent, but Mary got Jesus.
* Had Jude not heeded the Spirit, perhaps there would be no Epistle of Jude, perhaps the church at that time would have missed the clear leading of the Lord to be wary of wolves in sheep clothing

> So I turn to you today, are you being heeding the voice of the Lord and being vigilant enough to do whats needful?

## II. Content (vs. 3b)



### 1.1 How you Contend

## II. Beware (vs. 4)

> READ VERSE 4

### 1. Crept in unaware: New people

### 2. Crept in unaware: Existing people

### 3. Crept in unaware: You

#### 2.2 Deny the Lord (4b)

## Conclusion
It's also interesting to note, that while in Jude we are being warned against false teachers and men who will creep in unaware to the degree of being equipped to abate or avoid it, it's easier said then done. If we look at the case of Joshua, he was assistant to Moses, his successor, led Israel to victory and
