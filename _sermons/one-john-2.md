# Verse by Verse 2:1-6

## Theme: Knowing God

Webster 1828 define's "know" as is:
> To perceive with certainty; to understand clearly; to have a clear and certain perception of truth, fact, or any thing that actually exists.

Question for you today will be, how well do you know God?

### Verse 1
* "My little children" - he was with Christ. If there is anyone who the credentials for this labelling it's him. He has been with
Christ, walked with him, talked with him, touched him in person. He has learned from the master. And now with that confidence,
and assurance, he is going to give us wisdom and assurance.
* I am glad the verse has the second sentence "And if any man sin.." 
* What does some of your bibles say, does it use the word advocate?

### Verse 2
* What is propitiation? 
> The act of appeasing wrath and conciliating the favor of an offended person; the act of making propitious.
* What word does some of your bible's use?
* His death was the satisfaction of God's wrath for our sin.
* I just love how John pushes further, to not just to our sin, but that of the world.
* This is important, because it speaks to the responsibility that comes with being a Christian - others.
* Did Jesus die for the sins of the whole world and if so, does it mean everyone is going to heaven?

### Verse 3
* Don't you just love the double "know"
* Coming back to the definition of "know" - to understand clearly
* Why is it so important to understand God clearly?
> Quality of knowledge, dictates your experience, your decision making and your actions
* For example: Shalom at 1.5 years old jumping off a bench and breaking her arm
* For example: A young teenager who parents say that drugs kill, but without experience, without knowing makes an emotional 
counter reaction to their advice and wastes their life.
* The quality of your Christian experience, it's power, it's effect and impact is based on how well you know God.
* Not your mum, dad, uncle, brother or sister, but you
* You will know that you know him, if you do what he commands.
* There comes that test again we saw in Chapter 1, about assessing ourselves?
* Not only are we required to know God, but also have a fair and good reflection of ourselves.
* Why is this important?

### Verse 4
