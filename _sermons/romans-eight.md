title: "Walking in the Spirit"
excerpt: "Sermon outline"

## Introduction:
In Jewish times, Israel would listen in large groups, as scripture was read. We got a pretty lengthy portion of scripture this,
but perhaps I can get 3 men to read scripture, v1-10, v11-20, v21-30. I will read the rest of the chapter.

## The Problem:
Last week we looked at the struggle with law and how we are free from it.
But let's review our journey thus far from the point of view of an unsaved man.
1. He starts off reading Romans 1 and learning about the author and the unrighteousness of man (Chapter 1)
2. He then reads of God's judgement to come (Chapter 2)
3. He then reads that all are under sin, for all have sinned and come short of the glory of God. He is a sinner. (Chapter 3)
4. In Chapter 4, he seems Abraham was saved by faith, and how faith is redeeming and he needs to believe.
5. In Chapter 5, he seems how in believing, he has peace with God through that faith
6. In Chapter 6, he sees the victory, that he is dead to sin and alive to God
7. In Chapter 7, he sees how he is released from the power of the Law

And so we enter Romans 8, as the Christian, our reader begins to ask but what do I do now. How do I navigate this life, it's challenges
and what confidence do I have?

Paul starts off reminding him, that he is free, and without pending judgement.
> Rom 8:1  There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.

But he also affirms, that previously his path was after the flesh, obeying it's lusts, but now there was a new way, a new way
to walk, a new path, a new journey and a new direction. Not only was he state changed, but now his direction would change.
And this is where Paul starts to share the new direction and way, or walking, and that in the Spirit.

## The Conclusion: Call To Action


### Extra
#### What does it mean when "For" is used at start of a sentence?
1. Reason or explanation: When "for" is used to indicate a reason or explanation, it introduces the purpose or cause behind an action or situation. For example:
 - "For that reason, I cannot attend the meeting."
 - "For your own safety, please wear a helmet."
2. Connecting ideas: "For" can also be used to connect ideas and provide additional information or support for a previous statement. In this case, it functions as a coordinating conjunction. For example:
 - "I enjoy hiking, for it allows me to connect with nature."
 - "She studied diligently, for she wanted to excel in her exams."
