### Extra
#### What does it mean when "For" is used at start of a sentence?
1. Reason or explanation: When "for" is used to indicate a reason or explanation, it introduces the purpose or cause behind an action or situation. For example:
 - "For that reason, I cannot attend the meeting."
 - "For your own safety, please wear a helmet."
2. Connecting ideas: "For" can also be used to connect ideas and provide additional information or support for a previous statement. In this case, it functions as a coordinating conjunction. For example:
 - "I enjoy hiking, for it allows me to connect with nature."
 - "She studied diligently, for she wanted to excel in her exams."
