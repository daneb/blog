## Structuring the message
1. Let the power of the "words" of God, steer the message and what needs to be said
1. Keep it short. You are using other's time. Treat it with respect.
1. Try aim for a 3 point outline (1 -> 1.1, 1.2, 2-> 2.1, 2.2, 2.3 etc)
1. At the start, state the problem or tension
1. Move through to the body, then make a call to action

## General tips
1. Read and re-read your portion of scripture (10 times)
1. Pray for the Lord's illumination
1. Pray for the day of it's delivery and open hearts
1. Make it practical, not theoretical
1. Don't form your own thoughts, but Holy Spirit led from the Word of God
1. On the day, try to start off by settling into the pulpit, read or pray first.
1. Practice, practice, practice - at a minimal, know the entire outline of by heart
1. Try focus your memory, around the key ideas and not necessarily each word
