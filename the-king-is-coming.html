            <h1>The King is Coming</h1>
<p>Up in the sky, the tempests rage,<br />
as the heaven's proclaim the coming age,<br />
where Jesus the Lamb, breaks vials of his own,<br />
as he pours out their tears all over his throne.<br />
His fury and wrath ascends to the highest,<br />
and shall descend to the deepest, where the darkest liest.</p>
<p>Down on the earth, in the land of men,<br />
The people dance and sing in their wicked den,<br />
Praising self, rejecting Him, denouncing the Cross<br />
Living their best life at great cost.<br />
They live to enjoy each new day,<br />
And steep themselves in comforts of rich array.</p>
<p>High up in heaven, the Lord mounts His horse,<br />
and prepares to descend and evil divorce,<br />
His Word like a sword proceeds from His mouth,<br />
As He commands his armies to gather out.<br />
Down to the earth they go,<br />
The righteous will avail with mighty bow.</p>
<p>In Sodom and Gomorrah, they see the signs,<br />
The earth is groaning but they remain benign.<br />
Flashes scatter across they sky,<br />
As the Lord breaks open every wretched lie.<br />
The fire and fury of His descendance unknown,<br />
As He comes to grant vengence to His very own.</p>
<p>Be-warned, be wary, murmur not and complain,<br />
For Jesus is coming, coming again,<br />
To rule and to reign,<br />
To scatter the rain,<br />
To dry up our tears,<br />
And wrestle all fears,<br />
Jesus, Jesus the King,<br />
Is coming again.</p>
