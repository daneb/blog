<h2 id="the-what">The WHAT</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Cover the Blessings of our Justification</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What justification is?
Now justified has 39 references in scriptures. 
Justification by definition, is act of justifying, showing to be just or conformable to the law. In law, showing of a sufficient
reason in court why a defendant did what he is called to answer.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Justification is about a process of proving someone is righteous.</li>
      <li>Someone who is righteous would have to provide proof - did you hold to the law in heart and practice?</li>
      <li>Well we fail there, so Jesus Christ stepped in an exonnorated us.</li>
      <li>For by grace, are ye saved through faith, not of works, it is a gift of God (justification, salvation).</li>
      <li>We are just before God, we have no sin, we are exonnorated.</li>
      <li>Being justified is about grace.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="the-how">The HOW</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Covers the Process of Justification
    <ul>
      <li>You see contrast between one man who sinned (Adam)</li>
      <li>And another, who we received redemption (Christ)</li>
      <li>How death passed upon all men</li>
      <li>We will see our standing before God</li>
      <li>Just the beauty of the mechanism, the means, the HOW - Jesus Christ justified us to make us righteous</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>Read (v1-11)</p>

<h3 id="let-us-pray">Let us pray</h3>

<h2 id="problem">Problem</h2>
<h3 id="1-focused-on-the-battle-against-sin">1. Focused on the battle against sin</h3>

<ul>
  <li>As Christians, we live in the world of sin. Not only are we tained by sin, but we are tempted by the lusts of our flesh.
    <blockquote>
      <p>Jas 1:14  But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed.
The weights and battle of sin can be so heavy at times and that it instead of focusing on who we are, and our blessings in Christ,
we focus on who we are not.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>Instead of focusing our gaze on Christ, we put our focus an attention on sin and the battle against sin.</li>
  <li>This morning, perhaps, in your pursuit of being holy, you have placed the focus on our battle with sin as opposed to Christ, and not
just Christ alone, but the blessings of salvation, and our identity in Christ.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="2-an-example-setting-captives-free">2. An Example: Setting Captives Free</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Many years ago, I was involved in an online men’s ministry called ‘Setting Captives Free’. I believed I mentioned it once before.
Part of this ministry was to enable men to move away from their habitual sin, or sexual sins. These were men caught up
in pornography, self-pleasure and homosexuality.</li>
  <li>Our aim as mentors, where to be accountability partners enabling them to understand who they are in Christ but more so get them focus on Christ
and not their battle with sin.</li>
  <li>One of the lesson’s we tried to communicate, was that no matter how many measures they had put in place to prevent sin (radical amputation) it
would not set them free. However in understanding who they were in Christ and the blessings justification, would help them move past from
feeling and being defeated, to live out who they are in Christ, righteous and redeemed.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="3-overview-of-whats-to-come">3. Overview of whats to come</h3>
<ul>
  <li>This morning, I pray that the Holy scriptures, would open our eyes to the blessings of being justified. To remind us, how equipped we are,
how blessed we are, and to remind us, not to get caught up in the battle against sin, but to get caught up in a love for Christ.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="main">Main</h2>

<h3 id="1-the-logical-argument-in-romans-vs-1">1. The Logical Argument in Romans (vs. 1)</h3>
<h4 id="11-the-therefore-references-and-chaining-vs-1">1.1 The Therefore: References and Chaining (vs. 1)</h4>
<ul>
  <li>v1 start’s out with the word, “therefore”, and our immediate question should be, “but what’s it therefore?”</li>
  <li>Firstly, “therefore” is used about 29 times. 4 notable times as introduction to chapters, 2:1, 5:1, 8:1, 12:1.</li>
  <li>This affirms to us that Paul is making a rational argument that is chained. It’s like a house with a foundation,
where one part builds upon another.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="12-the-therefore-looking-back-vs-1">1.2 The Therefore: Looking back (vs. 1)</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Secondly, it’s a reflection, of what has taken place prior. “Therefore” means we need to look back to previous,
verse, chapter or chapters.</li>
  <li>We have seen, the Jews, Gentiles and all under condemnation.</li>
  <li>We have seen that sin abounds, and none are righteous, no not one. Like sheep, they have gone astray unto their own way.</li>
  <li>But now the plate is set, the cultery has arrived and it’s to begin the main course.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="2-the-blessings-of-christ-vs-1-6">2. The Blessings of Christ (vs. 1-6)</h3>
<h4 id="21-peace-with-god-vs-1">2.1 Peace with God (vs. 1)</h4>
<ul>
  <li>To not be at peace, means you at war. Imagine being apprehend and taken to court to present your case. As you stand, 
the judge that steps in is the very person you spent your entire life fighting against. Your final judgement is not going to end well.
How more so with the Lord God, the ultimate judge. Hell is real, despite what the world may say, what the catholic church may deny. 
But far more, hell and death will be cast into the lake of fire. If you thought hell was fiery, if you thought death was to be feared,
then you ain’t see nothing yet, your destination if not saved today is that lake of fire, where both hell and death themselves are destined.
    <blockquote>
      <p>“God is jealous, and the LORD revengeth; the LORD revengeth, and is furious; the LORD will take vengeance on his adversaries, 
and he reserveth wrath for his enemies.”</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>But if you saved today, brother and sister, God is not our enemy, and we, we, have peace with God. You have peace with God today 
and for all eternity to come. Amen!</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="22-access-into-his-grace-vs2a">2.2 Access into his grace (vs.2a)</h4>
<h5 id="i-immersed-in-grace">(i) Immersed in grace</h5>
<ul>
  <li>Not only do we have peace, but we also have grace. It’s easy to miss in the verse, but that access to grace is gated.</li>
  <li>It is denied to all but granted to a few. Those who choose by faith to believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, His death, burial and resurrection.</li>
  <li>Not only do we have access to this grace, by faith, we are almost placed in it, as scripture says “wherein we stand”. We are immersed in His grace. It evelops us.</li>
  <li>It reminds me of a tornado, that spins in furious destruction, yet in the centre is this vortex, this peace, this calm a place within the storm, 
in fact at it’s very heart, and us placed inside it. The sin of the world spins in it’s fury, but friend, we are in the eye of the storm and it’s perfect.</li>
  <li>We are immersed in grace.
    <blockquote>
      <p>“Grace, grace. God’s grace, grace that is greater than all our sin”.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
</ul>

<h5 id="ii-active-in-grace">(ii) Active in Grace</h5>
<ul>
  <li>But note, access to this grace doesn’t assume ease. Being immersed in the grace is the posture of standing. It’s active, engaged and ready to act. 
Not only is it’s active, it’s present tense. Not where we stood, but where we stand.</li>
  <li>Perhaps you in a phase of your Christian walk, where the tornado has moved, and you have sat done in the grace of old.
    <blockquote>
      <p>2 Cor 8:7  Therefore, as ye abound in every thing, in faith, and utterance, and knowledge, and in all diligence, and in your love to us, see that ye abound in this grace also.
2 Cor9:8  And God is able to make all grace abound toward you; that ye, always having all sufficiency in all things, may abound to every good work:</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>Where are you today? Are you immersed in that grace?
    <blockquote>
      <p>2Tim 2:1  Thou therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="23-hope-in-the-glory-of-god-vs2b">2.3 Hope in the Glory of God (vs.2b)</h4>
<ul>
  <li>In order to tackle this we have to work backwards. We have 3 parts
    <ul>
      <li>The glory of God</li>
      <li>Hope</li>
      <li>We Rejoicing
        <h5 id="i-the-glory-of-god">(i) The glory of God</h5>
        <blockquote>
          <p>1Cor 10:31  Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God
2Co_4:6  For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ</p>
        </blockquote>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The glory of God is magnificence of God and beauty of His divine attributes.</li>
  <li>If anything brothers and sisters, our God is glorious. For now as we sit here, He is our heart, our longing, we desire Him, we open up scripture so we
can behold Him, He is our joy in trial, our strength in pain, our light in darkness. He is altogether lovely.</li>
  <li>Yet while we have a relationship with Him at a distance, oh the day, oh the day, when we shall behold Him who is altogether lovely,
when the very desire of our hearts meets reality, when we see Him, hold Him, touch Him and gaze into His beauty. To hear Him speak, oh the day, what a glorious day.
    <h5 id="ii-our-hope">(ii) Our Hope</h5>
  </li>
  <li>Here to friends, brethren, lies our hope. This is our assurance, this is what we cling to in the darkness, this is what propels us forward, 
this is what propelled the saints of old, martyrs for the faith, who faced torture, persecution, hanging, beating and loss for the glory, 
for the glory of God.
    <h5 id="iii-our-rejoicing">(iii) Our Rejoicing</h5>
  </li>
  <li>This is why we rejoice. This is why we can rejoice, for that hope, the hope to behold Him, but not only with His beauty and closeness. 
But the security, the comfort, that we are with the Almighty God, no hand should move, no power will crumble, no tragedy shall befall us,
no tears in our eyes - but to rejoice when we behold Him who is altogether lovely.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="24-glory-in-tribulations-vs-3-5a">2.4 Glory in Tribulations (vs. 3-5a)</h4>
<h5 id="241-definition-of-tribulation">2.4.1 Definition of Tribulation</h5>
<ul>
  <li>Hold on, Paul is saying that God has given us a blessing in being able to glory in tribulation?</li>
  <li>Perhaps let’s define “tribulation” first.
    <blockquote>
      <p>Severe affliction; distresses of life; vexations.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>Wow, this is a tough one, how’s this a blessing?</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="242-an-example-of-suffering">2.4.2 An Example of Suffering</h5>
<ul>
  <li>I was speaking to a friend. He is highly inteliigent, known for his rational thought process and his ability to think clearly and effectively.</li>
  <li>As we spoke, he uncovered challenges in his life he was facing. His wife had completed her masters, done her intership, written exams, 
finished top of her class only to be denied registration to officially practice because she was from Zim.</li>
  <li>Secondly, on top of that, he only living parent had just developed a brain tumor. And he was the only bread winner and weight on 
his shoulders to help bring her out left him helpless. My heart sank as I empathized with him. But what made my heart even more moved, 
was that he came to the conclusion from Victor Frankles books ‘Man Search for meaning’ that the meaning of life was “to embrace your suffering”,
to own it.</li>
  <li>He struggled with this, because he just couldn’t understand, how one person could exerience such extreme pain (like a child being abused), 
vs someone who got to live life to the full, to have kids, to move through life almost unhindered. And he stated he didn’t understand this gap, 
this variance - why did some have to suffer while others didn’t.</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="243-the-history-of-trials">2.4.3 The History of Trials</h5>
<h6 id="i-the-challenge-of-understanding-trials-heb-1132-40">(i) The Challenge of understanding trials (Heb 11:32-40)</h6>
<ul>
  <li>Friends, suffering, and why some suffer more then others is not one easy to answer. Only God fully understands the journey, it’s meaning and value.
Sometimes that clearer than other times, sometimes we are left be-wildered. Do I understand why my dad left at my birth, 
or why my mother died when I was at 11? Why this suffering, while others kids grow up with warm loving parents.</li>
  <li>The answer, I don’t know God’s ways. But I do know, He’s prepared us for it. But scripture does tell us more.</li>
  <li>Let’s turn to
    <blockquote>
      <p>READ Hebrews 11:32-40.
vs. 40 - how amazing is this brothers and sisters, these great and mighty witnesses, accomplished so much and endured so much 
(torture, lions, death, pain), and now I recognized by God in this book the Bible. But they were only the frame of the puzzle, 
and we the completion of it. We were given so much more, then them, because would have Jesus. And together we are linked.</p>
      <h6 id="ii-encouragement-in-trial">(ii) Encouragement in Trial</h6>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>Let’s move on, to
    <blockquote>
      <p>READ Hebrews 12. (Heb 12:1-2).</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>Here we can see Paul encouraging us, to lay aside every weight,</li>
  <li>We can glory, see the wonder in tribulation because God has set an expectation, has given us warning, given us heavenly blessings, 
an example of men and women who have suffered, but also the general value of suffering. This is far more, then the rest of the world has.</li>
  <li>But it does not stop there right, we are given Christ, the author and finisher of our faith. We may not understand, but we are equipped.</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="244-the-benefits-of-trials-vs-3b-5">2.4.4 The Benefits of Trials (vs. 3b-5)</h5>
<h6 id="a-patience-vs-3">(a) Patience (vs. 3)</h6>
<ul>
  <li>As we read vs. 3-5, we see the benefit of the tribulations (severe persecution) we face, that severe persecution brings forth patience.</li>
  <li>Patience is something we all familiar with, as parent’s with kids, we used to teachings lessons on it.
    <blockquote>
      <p>Dad, Mum are we there yet?
Dad, I’m hungry?</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>But patience is more then just waiting for something.</li>
  <li>The modern dictionary defines patience,
    <blockquote>
      <p>the ability to wait, or to continue doing something despite difficulties</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>But the 1828 Webster’s dictionary, from a Biblical perspective, defines patience as:
    <blockquote>
      <p>The suffering of afflictions, pain, toil, calamity, provocation or other evil, with a calm, unruffled temper;
endurance without murmuring or fretfulness.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>Tribulation’s in our lives teaches us this patience.</li>
  <li>But isn’t this the general principle of life?</li>
  <li>Whether atheletes training for a competition (Eric Lindell)</li>
  <li>In being an effective worker in the workplace, moaners, complainers and those with weak temperant are often pushed aside</li>
  <li>Whether it be a child being born, the mother bears the burden of 9 months of carry, and culminates in momentary suffering to bring forth her child</li>
  <li>This is the natural reality of life and living. And something we all need refreshing on.</li>
  <li>May the Lord continue to open our eyes, and work patience in us, unto His Glory
    <blockquote>
      <p>Rom 15:4  For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
</ul>

<h5 id="ii-experience-vs-4">(ii) Experience (vs. 4)</h5>
<ul>
  <li>When we are patient, it brings forth experience.
    <blockquote>
      <p>Experience is defined as series of trials or experiments; active effort or attempt to do or prove something
It is the knowledge gained from trials.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>Effective Christians are Christians with experience. They are able to navigate difficulties others wouldn’t, have a confidence that others lack,
and courage when courage lacks</li>
  <li>The knowledge these Christian’s gain, is four-fold,
    <ol>
      <li>a deeper understanding of trials</li>
      <li>more peace in the midst of trials,</li>
      <li>a deeper knowledge about themselves</li>
      <li>and more so a deeper knowledge of God.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<h5 id="iii-hope">(iii) Hope</h5>
<ul>
  <li>And why is this knowledge gained from these trials (experience) valuable, because it gives us hope.
    <blockquote>
      <p>Rom 8:24  For we are saved by hope: but hope that is seen is not hope: for what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for?
Rom 8:25  But if we hope for that we see not, then do we with patience wait for it.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>Hope is defined as:
    <blockquote>
      <p>desire of some good, accompanied with at least a slight expectation of obtaining it, or a belief that it is obtainable.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>The more tribulations we endure patiently, will produce experience, and the more experiences we have (knowledge gained in Christ),
 the deeper our knowledge of Him will be and the stronger our hope will be</li>
  <li>Tribulations worketh patience, and patience, experience and experience hope.</li>
  <li>But note the affirmation from Paul in vs.5, with confidence he says “hope maketh not ashamed”. Why?</li>
  <li>Because when we have hope in God as we come through the trial, God’s love covers our hearts, envelops it through the Holy Spirit which is given to us.</li>
  <li>When we experience tribulation and come out the other side with hope in God, we experience a deeper richer experience of His love. Is that not what
we see in testimonies of brothers and sisters who take this pulpit? Of those cloud of witnesses?</li>
  <li>Hope, Hope brothers and sister’s will not make you ashamed!</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I want to leave you with three thoughts,</p>
<ol>
  <li>We are justified
I have only touched a part of the many more blessings found in Chapter 5, I’ve only touched on a few.
But we have them, because we are justified by Him. Justified, that means we have been lawfully declared righteous through faith.</li>
  <li>Don’t carry the burden of past sins
Brothers and sisters we are righteous. We are God’s children. 
Our sin yesterday, our sin today and every future sin is under the blood. Jesus has atoned for it. 
Don’t carry the burden of past sins.
    <blockquote>
      <p>2Cor 5:17  Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.</p>
    </blockquote>

  <li>Fall in love with Jesus, don’t obssess about your battle with sin
If you are struggling with sin this morning, be mindful about being too focused on your battle with sin, fall in love with Jesus. 
It’s easy to be remorseful, to want to correct actions, but they actions around purity will never hold fast, till Jesus Christ’s love for you is the motivator.
Pursue Him, Trust Him, Love Him and when those tribulations come, stand fast, stand fast! For at the end of tribulations is hope,
and to that end is a deeper experience of love from Him.</li>
