<h2 id="verse-by-verse-21-6">Verse by Verse 2:1-6</h2>

<h3 id="theme-knowing-god">Theme: Knowing God</h3>

<p>Webster 1828 define’s “know” as is:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>To perceive with certainty; to understand clearly; to have a clear and certain perception of truth, fact, or any thing that actually exists.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Question for you today will be, how well do you know God?</p>

<h4 id="verse-1">Verse 1</h4>
<ul>
  <li>“My little children” - he was with Christ. If there is anyone who the credentials for this labelling it’s him. He has been with
Christ, walked with him, talked with him, touched him in person. He has learned from the master. And now with that confidence,
and assurance, he is going to give us wisdom and assurance.</li>
  <li>I am glad the verse has the second sentence “And if any man sin..”</li>
  <li>What does some of your bibles say, does it use the word advocate?</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="verse-2">Verse 2</h4>
<ul>
  <li>What is propitiation?
    <blockquote>
      <p>The act of appeasing wrath and conciliating the favor of an offended person; the act of making propitious.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>What word does some of your bible’s use?</li>
  <li>His death was the satisfaction of God’s wrath for our sin.</li>
  <li>I just love how John pushes further, to not just to our sin, but that of the world.</li>
  <li>This is important, because it speaks to the responsibility that comes with being a Christian - others.</li>
  <li>Did Jesus die for the sins of the whole world and if so, does it mean everyone is going to heaven?</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="verse-3">Verse 3</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Don’t you just love the double “know”</li>
  <li>Coming back to the definition of “know” - to understand clearly</li>
  <li>Why is it so important to understand God clearly?
    <blockquote>
      <p>Quality of knowledge, dictates your experience, your decision making and your actions</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>For example: Shalom at 1.5 years old jumping off a bench and breaking her arm</li>
  <li>For example: A young teenager who parents say that drugs kill, but without experience, without knowing makes an emotional 
counter reaction to their advice and wastes their life.</li>
  <li>The quality of your Christian experience, it’s power, it’s effect and impact is based on how well you know God.</li>
  <li>Not your mum, dad, uncle, brother or sister, but you</li>
  <li>You will know that you know him, if you do what he commands.</li>
  <li>There comes that test again we saw in Chapter 1, about assessing ourselves?</li>
  <li>Not only are we required to know God, but also have a fair and good reflection of ourselves.</li>
  <li>Why is this important?</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="ice-breaker">Ice-breaker</h2>
<p>If you could be a cartoon character, who would you be and why?</p>

<h2 id="ruth">Ruth</h2>

<p><strong>Question</strong>: What can you guys tell me about the book of Ruth?</p>

<h3 id="context">Context:</h3>
<p>The context for book of Ruth, is that book of Judges. Despite the prevailing apostasy, there were individuals living godly lives, 
seeking to rule their lives by the law of Moses and free from corruption.</p>

<p>It’s one of the most beautiful stories in scripture, a romance novel.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Who can tell me what the theme of Ruth is?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The theme is one of ‘redemption’. It speaks of one a Moabite, who was dwelling in darkness, and was introduced to one
who became her kinsman-redeemer and Lord.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What or who is a kinsman-redeemer?
Is a male relative, who according to various laws of the Pentateuch, had the privilege and responsibility to act on behalf
of a relative who was in trouble, danger or need. In Hebrew (go el), designates one who delivers or rescues (Numbers 5:6)</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="summary-1">Summary</h3>
<p>Ruth was in utter darkness - not only was she not an Israelite, but she was also of a people who God had leglislated against (Deu 23:3-4).
But we see God’s redemption for what was previously cursed, as he lifted her into a royal line and gave her a living link
with God himself (Matthew 1:5) [ Ruth begat Obed, Obed begat Jesse, Jesse begate David].</p>

<h4 id="the-five-links">The Five Links</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Famine - famine took over the land in Judah,</li>
  <li>Family - Elimelech with his wife and two daughters went to Moab for respite</li>
  <li>Funerals - Naomi’s husband dies and marries Moabite women. But then the two sons die.
    <blockquote>
      <p>What were the two woman’s names? Orpah and Ruth</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>Fear - Naomi wanted to return to her people and say goodbye to her two daughters, leaving them with their family
    <blockquote>
      <p>v14 - READ IT</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>Field - READ Chapter 2:1 They arrived in Bethelem and sort means to provide for themselves. She went to pick in the field.
It is from here, she lays at his feet and he purchases her according to the redemption laws of Israel to make her his very own.</li>
</ol>

<p>From here the story moves quickly, as we see them being married and Ruth, and how a kinsman-redeemer redeems her from darkness into light.</p>

<h2 id="1-john-23-4">1 John 2:3-4</h2>

<p>The interesting thing about 1 John is that we see alot of repetition. In fact, it’s re-inforcement of similar truths and thoughts.</p>
<ul>
  <li>You say you love God, but do you.</li>
  <li>You say you walk in the light, but are you.</li>
  <li>You are saved, have confidence in Him.</li>
</ul>

<p>The majority if not all of the book can be summed up in a paragraph. But it is the depth of issues, that places the burden to communicate them well
and effectively.</p>

<h3 id="verse-3-1">Verse 3</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Quite simply, if you understand God clearly, and you say you know, well you can know this by your actions.</li>
  <li>Not just what you doing, but that you are being obediant to what God would have you.</li>
  <li>This comes in a few forms:
(1) Being obediant to the Bible 
(2) Being obediant to the heeding of the Spirit</li>
</ul>

<p>Sometimes the Spirit in a moment or situation will lead you, this person needs a tract, or this person needs a friend, or you need to go to the front of
the church because it’s an alter call. Whatever it may be, it’s important to heed the Spirit, so you build the habit of hearing His words and when He speaks.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How do you know it’s not the Spirit but your own flesh or poor judgement? Gut feel.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Where you are in your walk with Christ today, good standing or the relationship a bit strained</li>
    <li>Is it aligned with God’s word?</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="example">Example</h4>
<ul>
  <li>On street, do I street preach and bellow it out like a crazy person. Do I shout Jesus Saves, Jesus Saves?</li>
  <li>The only way to know sometimes is just to do. Don’t overthink, if you feel the prompting of Christ at the beckoning of the word</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="verse-4">Verse 4</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The Words here are very clear.</li>
  <li>We are either doing what God says, or we are not. And if we say we know him, well is it showing?</li>
  <li>We make ourselves liars when we choose not to act in accordance with the word.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Let’s flip it around. If we obeyed all the commandments would that mean we know God?</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="verse-5">Verse 5</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Here’s that test again but in another form.</li>
  <li>If we keep his commandments, not only do we know that we know him. But the love of God is perfected.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>What is this love of God?</p>
  <ul>
    <li>It’s God love unto us</li>
    <li>It’s God’s son dying on the cross for us (1 John 4:19)</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="verse-6">Verse 6</h3>
<p>Here’s the beauty, and it almost looks like he is saying the same thing.
But what’s different now to how you work, how well you know Him, is that it’s not just tied to a bunch of text.
But it’s in response to the life, death and burial of Jesus, more than that, it’s tied to an actual person. Someone who you have a relationship with.
Talk to, listen to, follow and love.</p>

<p>This is what seperate Christianity, we are not a dead religion, we are not a set of commandments, we are loved, and have someone to love.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Gen 49:10  The sceptre shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh come; and unto him shall the gathering of the people be.

<h3 id="a-new-commandment">A New Commandment</h3>
<ol>
  <li>How would you define a commandments?</li>
  <li>It’s important to explore meaning of words. It can take on new dimensions and help explain tension you may feel in the passage
or a set of verses.</li>
  <li>Again the true definition of a word is not in a dictionary, but as the bible defines it. It’s very rarely different to a dictionary,
but when it does it can help illuminate the word.</li>
  <li>Perhaps today we can explore the nature of commandments and how words in scripture have so much power and their own nature?

<h2 id="1-john-28-12">1 John 2:8-12</h2>

<h3 id="verse-8">Verse 8</h3>
<ol>
  <li>What do we remember from last time - what is this new commandment? (old commandment refreshed)</li>
  <li>What is this darkness that is now past? Glorious gospel and salvation, the dispensation of law is past.</li>
  <li>What is the dispensation we in called?</li>
  <li>Where did people in the Old Testament go when they died?</li>
  <li>What is the true light?</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="verse-9">Verse 9</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Who is your brother in this context?</li>
  <li>We will pick up on this again in verse 11</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="verse-10">Verse 10</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Here we see the repetition of 1 John. 1 John could be summed up in a large paragraph.</li>
  <li>John is trying to impress vital truths.</li>
  <li>When you love God and your neighbour, your clear you way so you can navigate life effectively.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="verse-11">Verse 11</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Darkness blinds, and causes you to stumble. When you hold grudges, despise, turn your eyes from Christ to others, you enter into darkness</li>
  <li>Darkness also masks sin (you can’t see it, bias; but also other’s can’t see what you are doing)</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="verse-12">Verse 12</h3>
<ol>
  <li>John reminds us that we have victory over sin.</li>
  <li>Not for our sake, but for Christ’s. Our sin is removed because of Christ.</li>
  <li>God loves us, He does, but our merit, the reason we were grafted in, was because of Christ.</li>
</ol>
