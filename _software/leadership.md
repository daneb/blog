## 1. Rules of Managing
> Only by pride cometh contention - Proverbs 13:10

	* Lead by example but don't absolve responsibility.
	* Delegate.
	* Record all interactions, document and distribute.
	* Changes to processes need solid agreement.
	* Collaborate instead of dictate, but dictate when collaboration can't reach resolution.
	* Conflict is a natural part of business and it's healthy. Particularly where the individuals come from different backgrounds. This allows the shaping of problems and solutions in different ways. It's important to recognize that and to share your views (that are different) in a cordial manner. Contention is usually a sign of your ego kicking in.
	* In setting a new course or direction, it is often times not enough to just point and say go. It requires education, inspiration and motivation of those who are being asked to follow.

## 2. Manager's User Manual

### What is this
It's the essence of how I operate as a Manager.
This is not a list of rules of how I operate, but the under-current of values and thinking that guides those operations.

* I am human
* I am a passionate husband and father. My family is a strong focus and my inspiration.
* I am an introvert, a creative, a change agent, potential seeker and a servant-leader.
* An avid reader and struggling gamer, yeah 3 kids ;)
* Truly enjoy yoga!

### How I manage

1. I aim to set clear expectations and be direct about it's accountability. When I fail to do so adequately, please feedback.
I have a natural and genuine care for those who I am responsible for.
2. I eagerly welcome feedback with facts, examples and/or specifics. Vice versa.
3. If it doesn't work, lets build a plan, or just get rid of it.
I aim to do whats right. But sometimes right is not effective. If not harmful, do whats effective.
4. Everyone desires to give their best and is sincere in what they are trying to communicate.
5. "We don't click" can be an emotion based on the spiralling stories we have told ourselves. Seperate the facts from the stories.
6. I enjoy collaboration particularly with the multiplicity and diversity of minds.
7. If you not getting to deep work, reach out, I will do my utmost to figure out how to unblock you.
I am work in progress.
8. Critical thinking is not hard and imperfect. However it is not winning, it's weighing. Critical thinking needs to criticize something..

### Areas I'm working to improve...

* Switching too quickly from problem definition to problem resolution.
* Effecting change at a less rapid rate (at times).
* Understand that some people struggle with candour in both accepting and giving it.
* When criticism to me is given to apply silence to the process so the person being courageous can have confidence to do it again.
* People take time to think and to make a point / question / statement. Don't just dismiss what their saying. Carefully and succinctly deal with it despite how insignificant it may appear to me.
* Don't just talk, do. And when others beat you to it, praise and rejoice with them.
* Not all ideas worth pursuing, are worth pursuing well.

### One-on-ones
* Focus on 85% - “How am I making your work more stressful than it needs to be?”
* Maintain a Trello Board of the conversation (focus on areas of growth, relationship and impact):w

### Ideas
Ideas sometimes need education to live and thrive.
