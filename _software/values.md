title: "Values that underpin"
excerpt: "The concepts and abstractions that steer my thinking"
---

## My approach to life is guided by 5 principals (5 BE's):
* Be Simple - Large doors swing on small hinges (problems)
* Be Confident - Know you can. Trust you can. Practice so you can (attitude)
* Be Focused - Limit the scope to whats manageable and what produces the most immediate feedback (productivity)
* Be True - True To Self. True To Others. Seek truth in every situation as it's the only effective way to diagnose reality (character)
* Be Consistent - Habits done consistently produce effectivity (actions)

## Four core values
1. Radical Candour - caring for others requires candid communication.
2. Mutual Purpose - manage the stories we tell ourselves about others. In conflict seek to understand your purpose and that of the other person.
3. Psychological Safety - the effectiveness of our thinking relates to how we treat one another
4. Extreme Ownership - if the team fails it's my fault. I own the communication both up and down the chains.
5. Innovation - if a team is not innovating they are stagnating
