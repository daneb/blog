### Why Bible Versions Matter

To my dearest kids,

I hope one day in the future, when you read this, you will understand why I chose to use the King James Bible (KJB). First I am going to make some bold claims, substantiate them, and then explain why it matters to you. There is much literature on this topic, some very good, some very bad. I will delve into my own personal reasoning and touch on some of the academic side. But ultimately the decision will be yours to make. We have instilled you with what we believe to be the truth, and it is from that foundation we implore you to seek out the truth for yourselves.

#### The Bible is the Word of God
The Bible version argument matters, because words are powerful and carry meaning. When you alter the words, you alter the meaning. When you alter the meaning you alter the intent. When you alter the intent, you lose the message of God. So are all Bible versions created equal? No. The King James Bible is the preserved Word of God in the English language and it is inerrant and infallible. Other versions are not.
Other versions take the approach of choosing to either focus on the "meaning" of the text (dynamic equivalence) or a mix of meaning and word-for-word (optimal equivalence). This opens the door to human interpretation and error. The KJB takes a word-for-word approach (formal equivalence) which preserves the original text as closely as possible. This is important because God’s Word is perfect and any deviation from it can lead to misunderstanding and misapplication. 

Now are other Bibles heretical? Yes some are clearly flawed and devisive. Other modern versions largely do contain significant sound doctrine and the gospel. If you recall, I was saved and led to the Lord from an NIV. Would I recommend that Bible to you, no, I'll explain shortly. Within these modern translations are subtle changes that can lead to doctrinal errors over time. For example, some versions have altered verses that speak about the deity of Christ, salvation by grace through faith, and the nature of God. These changes can lead to confusion and misinterpretation of essential Christian doctrines. There is much to be said about the men who translated them, but that is for another time. My bigger concern is the base manuscripts they used. The problem is not the back to a single set of manuscripts, but a clear division between two families of manuscripts: the Textus Receptus (TR) and the Alexandrian texts. The KJB is based on the Textus Receptus, which has been preserved through the ages and is considered by many scholars to be the most reliable text. Modern versions often rely on the Alexandrian texts, which are older but have been subject to more corruption and alteration over time. This leads to significant differences in key verses that affect doctrine and practice.

I say all this to say, if we don't have the correct word of God, then we don't have the correct view of God. This is why Bible versions matter. 

> Disclaimer: For anyone reading this who would like to label me a KJB onlyist, I am not. I believe that God can and does use other versions to reach people. I also believe that God can and does use other versions to teach and edify believers. However, I believe that the KJB is the best version available in the English language and it is the one I choose to use and recommend. 

#### Why I believe the KJB is the preserved Word of God
1. **Divine Preservation**: I believe that God has promised to preserve His Word throughout history (Psalm 12:6-7, Matthew 5:18). The KJB is the culmination of this divine preservation in the English language.
2. **Historical Preservation**: The KJB has a long history of being preserved and used by English-speaking Christians for over 400 years. It has stood the test of time and has been a source of spiritual nourishment for countless believers.
3. **Textual Basis**: The KJB is based on the Textus Receptus, which has been preserved through the ages and is considered by many scholars to be the most reliable text. Modern versions often rely on the Alexandrian texts, which are older but have been subject to more corruption and alteration over time.
4. **Doctrinal Soundness**: The KJB has been shown to be doctrinally sound and consistent with the teachings of the early church. It has been used to defend orthodox Christian beliefs against heresies and false teachings throughout history. I've detailed some of these verses below. 
5. **Linguistic Beauty**: The KJB is known for its poetic and majestic language, which has had a profound impact on English literature and culture. Its language has a reverence and dignity that reflects the sacredness of the text.
6. **Education and Language**: The KJB has had a significant impact on the English language and has been a source of education for many generations. Its influence can be seen in literature, art, and culture. Yes it may require a 8th-10th grade education, but too truly unlock the bible takes dedication and study. 
7. **Academic Support**: Many scholars and theologians have defended the KJB as the preserved Word of God. Their research and writings provide a strong academic foundation for the belief in the KJB's authenticity and reliability. 
8. **Miscommunication in churches**: How does a church with multiple and highly varied Bible versions communicate and labour together effectively? One Bible is in support of female pastors, the other is against it. How can there be many forms of truth from one God? These leads me to the simple deduction, that all Bibles are equal, and there has to be one source of truth. The KJB is that source in the English language.

#### Why I don't believe modern versions are sufficient
1. **Textual Corruption**: Modern versions often rely on the Alexandrian texts, which have been subject to more corruption and alteration over time. This leads to significant differences in key verses that affect doctrine and practice.
2. **Doctrinal Errors**: Some modern versions contain subtle changes that can lead to doctrinal errors over time. For example, some versions have altered verses that speak about the deity of Christ, salvation by grace through faith, and the nature of God.
3. **Human Interpretation**: Modern versions often take a dynamic equivalence approach, which focuses on the "meaning" of the text rather than a word-for-word translation. This opens the door to human interpretation and error.
4. **Lack of Reverence**: Some modern versions use contemporary language that lacks the reverence and dignity of the KJB. This can lead to a casual approach to the text and a lack of appreciation for its sacredness.
5. **Harder to comprehend**: The big argument about modern versions is that it's easier to understand. There is no "thees" and "thous" to get in the way. Honestly, how hard is that to understand? Modern versions actually use more complex and longer words to replace simple ones found in the King James. For example, "commence" instead of "begin", "utilize" instead of "use", "endeavor" instead of "try". I cover this below in more detail.
6. **Aleph and B tied to the Catholic Church**: Vaticanus (B) was catalogued in the Vatican library in 1475, and is still the property of the Vatican. The Catholic Church has a long history of altering and corrupting the Bible, largely because they see the Pope as the ultimate authority on doctrine, not the Bible. That is not our position. We believe the Bible to be the final authority on all matters of faith and practice. Secondly, if you reference the [Trail of Blood](https://www.amazon.com/Trail-Blood-Classic-Account-Persecution/dp/0932762183) you will see that the Catholic Church was responsible for the persecution and martyrdom of millions of believers throughout history. With these 2 points it leaves me concerned about basing my Bible on manuscripts tied to such an institution.

#### What particularly concerns me about modern versions
1. **Omission of Verses**: Some modern versions omit verses that are present in the KJB, which can lead to a loss of important doctrinal teachings. For example, verses like Mark 16:9-20 and John 7:53-8:11 are often omitted in modern versions. Not to mention the Josephine Comma in 1 John 5:7-8 which is completely left out of almost all modern versions.
2. **Alteration of Key Doctrines**: Some modern versions alter key doctrines, such as the nature of Christ and salvation. For example, some versions change verses that speak about the deity of Christ or the necessity of faith for salvation (John 1:1, Romans 3:28).
3. **Use of Questionable Manuscripts**: Modern versions often rely on manuscripts that are considered less reliable by many scholars. This can lead to a distortion of the original message of the Bible. 
4. **The Attack on the Deity of Christ**: Here are some of the most significant changes found in the modern versions where Christ's deity is either removed or altered. For simplicity I am just going to compare the KJB to ESV and NASB. 

#### 17 completely omitted verses including:

Acts 8:37 - "I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God" (entire confession removed)
Matthew 18:11 - "For the Son of man is come to save that which was lost" (mission statement removed)
1 John 5:7 - "the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one" (Trinity statement removed)
Romans 16:24 - "The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all" (benediction removed)

##### 29-50 additional verses with partial changes affecting Christ:

1 Timothy 3:16 - "God was manifest" → "He was manifested" (deity statement weakened)
Colossians 1:14 - "through his blood" removed (atonement reference deleted)
John 9:35 - "Son of God" → "Son of Man" (divine title changed to human)
Ephesians 3:9 - "created all things by Jesus Christ" removed
Multiple verses where "Lord Jesus Christ" shortened to just "Christ" or "Jesus"

##### The Most Critical Changes:

1 Timothy 3:16 - Changes "God was manifest in the flesh" to "He was manifested" - removes explicit statement of God becoming man
1 John 5:7 - Removes "the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one" - explicit Trinity
John 1:18 - Changes "only begotten Son" to "only God" - affects eternal sonship doctrine
Acts 8:37 - Removes "I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God" - confession formula


#### Modern Versions are harder to read

1. Precision Requires Technical Terms
> Example: Romans 12:1

- KJV: "reasonable service" (simple words)
- ESV: "spiritual worship" (longer, harder words)
Why? Better Greek scholarship shows "spiritual" more accurately translates logikēn than "reasonable," even though it's a harder English word

2. False Friends Are Worse Than Hard Words
> KJV: "Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live"

**Computer says**: "5th grade!" (short words)
**Modern reader thinks**: "Don't allow a witch to experience pain"
ACTUAL meaning: "Don't permit a witch to live"
Comprehension: FAIL

> Modern: "You shall not allow a sorceress to live"

Computer says: "8th grade" (longer word)
Modern reader: Immediately understands
Comprehension: SUCCESS

3. Academic Translators Use Academic Vocabulary
ESV/NASB translators are seminary professors and PhDs. They naturally gravitate toward:

Theological precision ("predestined," "propitiation," "sanctification")
Academic register ("manifest," "effectual," "efficacious")
Technical accuracy over simplicity


#### Some Common counter arguments
1. **"The KJB is outdated and hard to understand."** While the language of the KJB may be archaic, it is also rich and poetic. Many believers find that the reverence and dignity of the language enhances their understanding and appreciation of the text. Also, the KJB because of it's poetic style and it's syllabic structure is easier to memorize. Memorization is a key aspect of Bible study and spiritual growth.
2. **Educational Background**: Some argue that modern versions are easier to understand for contemporary readers. While this may be true for some, it is important to remember that the Bible is not just a book to be read casually, but a sacred text that requires reverence and study. If you doing apologetics or deep Bible study, you will need to invest in learning the KJB language anyway. The Bible is it's own dictionary, and learning to navigate it is part of the journey. 
3. **"All versions are equally valid."** While it is true that all versions of the Bible contain elements of truth, not all versions are created equal. The KJB is the preserved Word of God in the English language and is the most reliable and doctrinally sound version available. The NASB, ESV, NIV, and others have significant issues that can lead to doctrinal errors and misunderstandings. The KJB is based on the majority text and all the others are based on the minority text (from Egyptian manuscripts). This is a big deal. What is symbolism of Egypt in the Bible? It represents falsehood and rebellion against God. Why would we want to base our Bible on manuscripts from such a source?
