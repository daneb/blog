title: "A Girl Worth Fighting For"
excerpt: "You are too me a “wife” worth dying for!"
---


> Often times I sit and wonder, at how truly blessed I am,  
It’s not just the wealth, job, house or car,  
Nor just the LORD and His saving power,  
But it’s in LORD and His love,  
In giving me YOU, this gift from above.  
  
You are too me a “girl” worth fighting for!  
You are sexy, sweet and charming all the same.  
And have quite the industrious brain.  
You have the most delightful smile  
That soothes my heart like the ‘Egyptian’ Nile.  

You are too me a “friend” worth caring for!  
You are there with LOVE each and every day,  
To help remove those dark clouds away.  
You are always there to listen, and care;  
Especially when my hearts sunk to despair.  
You never criticise or beat me down,  
But always there to change my frown.  
  
You are too me a “wife” worth dying for!  
I thank the LORD, our God, who saved us to ‘meet in His love’,  
That I could have a “true” gem like you,  
A “wife, a help meet” through and through.  
A wife  whose “heart” cares so deeply for mine,  
A woman whose “worth” could fill a life-time.  
You heart, joy and jubilation, makes me stand back in adoration.  
At the work of the “Saviour” within your heart,  
A true testament of His Grace in part.  
I love you more than mere mortals words can express,  
But I am thankful and I pray that with each new day,  
I would have the opportunity to display,  
That LOVE for you, in every way!  
  
Your husband
