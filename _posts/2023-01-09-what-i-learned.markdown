### Quotes:

#### Tiny Thought
> If you wait until you're motivated, you’ve already lost.
> Surgeons don’t always feel like doing surgery. Teachers don’t always feel like teaching. Parents don’t always feel like cooking. Firemen don’t always feel like rushing into a burning building.
> If you let motivation dictate your actions, inertia conspires to keep you in place.

> Action creates progress. Progress creates momentum. Momentum creates motivation.

### CAP Theorem
Your two choices: you have to choose between consistency or availability. You cannot have both.
This assumes 100% availability but you could have degrees of consistency along with availability (or vice versa).

### List.ForEach is not foreach (C#)
List.foreach will create isolated clojures that run Actions independently without side-affects.
foreach is synchronous and mutates.
