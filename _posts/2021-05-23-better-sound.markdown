As a software developer music has proven an essential aid. From keeping me awake during late night stints to a gentle ushering in the background when focus is called for. I have enjoyed streaming my music through the years and always believed that I was at the pinnacle of my desktop musical experience with my high-quality [Sennheiser HD 440](https://www.cnet.com/reviews/sennheiser-hd-448-review/). But most recently I was truly awakened to the fact that there was much more to pursue not by way of accessories but in audio quality. I had been streaming music at 44kHz while out there was a world of Hi-Res audio and even Master (studio quality). Let me explain.

## Audio at 44kHz
44kHz or 44,100Hz is a common sampling frequency for analog audio, dating back to the late 1970's in recording digital audio on video cassettes. CDs in fact were made at 44.1kHz/16bit. [Sampling](https://www.101computing.net/sampling-sound/) or the sample rate is the number of samples in one second. A small sample rate or interval, results in a high sample rate which results in better quality sound file but then also increases the size of that audio file. This sampling of the
sound wave is then converted into digestible binary data. So stated differently, 44,100Hz is basically 44,100 samples per second. 

The second part to the sampling is the [audio bit depth](https://www.izotope.com/en/learn/digital-audio-basics-sample-rate-and-bit-depth.html) at which that sampling can take place. Given analog audio is a continuous wave, it has effectively infinite number of possible amplitude values. However to sample, we would need to definite finite values for these amplitude values. Perhaps another way to consider this is that amplitude describes depth, and sample rate the length or
interval. 

A large depth, 32-bit versus 16-bit then means that when we sample we are able to express more possible values.

* 16-bit: 65,536 values
* 32-bit: 4,294,967,296 values

## Conclusion

Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes^. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
