One of the lesser talked about areas of a successful career, is that of a healthy and joyful marriage.
It's admittedly personal and private but is it not a key ingrediant or at the very least a factor for an effective mindset to produce your best work.
Provided you have chosen someone special in your life, tumult at home doesn't make for efficacy in the workplace. 
Challenges at home, challenges at work, challenges in your socio-economic context is a recipe for high stress.
One only need consider the impact of buying a house has on the productivity of an employee during that process. 
I've seen it with myself, but also team members who I have led. It usually leads to mental distractions, slower delivery and interruption. 
Home much more so, when you and the person closest to you, is in heated conflict.

I'm no expert, but should we not at least have the conversation and grow together. I've been in industry for 20+ years, and for the majority of that I've been married.
Since I've been married, I've been very intentional about ensuring my home and marriage are successfuWe are happily married this year for 13 years and it's been the best thing ever.
Because when the world turns into choas, it's great to turn over at night and find sanctity in a warm loving embrace. Someone who loves you despite it all.
Not only that, but in your spouse you will find your best critic for improvement - the person that can see into the deepest areas of your soul, has insight into all your behaviours
and is able to safely communicate it.

To open up the conversation, I wanted to share some high-level mechanics that's enabled us.

1. Your spouse must be your best friend
- Friends and family take second place to my wife
- In terms of prioritization, she is always critical and urgent :)

1. Your spouse must come before your kids
- The love of a child is unique, granted - but it never breaks the knot and first priority of a husband and wife.
- The foundation upholds the structure.

1. You must cleave to your spouse
- I don't take or need breaks from my wife
- I push myself towards her, and her to me
- We are partners, in each other we find courage, strength and love

1. You must be on the same mission
- Our goals in life are aligned, both for our kids, our family and our careers
- Largely we defined and articulated this prior to being married, in the initial steps of court-ship
- Before marriage, figure and decide the HARD things first

1. Don't let work be an excuse
- It's easy to allow work to become the priority to not be present in the relationship. Too easy in fact.
- Be mindful of this

1. Make the time
- Be present when your spouse speaks
- Engage them not only on your own concerns and frustrations, but ask them theres
- Be inquisitive about their ever evolving interests

These are some guiding principals, mileage will certainly vary. 
Please do share whats worked for you, or even what's not worked. Please share.

At the very least you forget everything you read in this article tomorrow, take away this one thing:
Be intentional about your relationship to the person you have dedicated to walking life's road with.

Marriage is a beautiful thing, and can be as beautiful as you make it.
