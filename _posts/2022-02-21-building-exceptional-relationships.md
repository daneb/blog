## The necessity

The need to maintain and build exceptional relationships has always been a critical success factor to career growth and progression. No more so at this point in history with the growth in remote work and it's supporting infrastructure. But this area of relationship building is entirely complex, and like most things in life, for which there is no formulae. But to improve it is required that we eat a piece off the elephant and hopefully with each bite we advance our knowledge and understanding. 

It is insufficient to just provide wisdom, or abstract principles and try apply them without doing due diligence on the complexities. Any action taken without context, is likely a wasted one. We must explore the pushes and the pulls, the actors, their roles and the environment in which their placed. To shorten the elephant, we will focus our process to the context of **business.**


## What makes relationship building hard

### Pushes and Pulls
Stress and strains that introduce friction in relationship largely involve mis-communication. Okay that is a bit of an over-generalization with little to no statistical data. But one needs only use themselves as a source of truth. I don't believe this is the single cause of all relationship erosion, but at least the 20% of the Pareto Principle in terms of efficacy and impact. There are many things one could do in terms of self-improvement to have more effective relationships, learning to be kind, respecting others and their views, controlling your emotions etc, but these are all sub-optimal alone and purely optimizations. The real treasure to chase is communication.

Now there are two parts to **communication**, speaking and listening. Stated differently, effectively saying what you need to say and active listening to obtain information.





### The Actors 

### Their Roles

### The Environment 


## The practices

### Don't fake it

### Active listening

### Becareful with advice 

### Think deeper
A leader when he creates a vision or direction, has to reflect depth of thought. No followers or forced followers will take a path unless the leader has spent sufficient time thinking through the journey, it's outcomes and if it's worth taking.
